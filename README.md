# IRBlasterWeb
Infra Red remote control blaster using esp8266

Transmits remote control codes freceived from Web.
Built in simple web page mainly for testing. ip/ir
Normal use is via POST messages. ip/irjson
Status check at ip/check
Update OTA to new binary firmare at ip/firmware
Macro facility using files stored on SPIFFS

Command arguments
  auth (pincode or password to match built in value)
  device (name of remote control, use 'null' if just wait required, use 'macro' to use a macro from SPIFFS)
  parameter
  repeat (number of times to send ir code)
  wait (mSec delay after sending code)
  bits 0 for default, non zero overrides device definition
  
  parameter is normally the name of the button on the control and the code to use is found in the device config.
    If % is the first char of the parameter then the following code is used rather than looking up in device config
	Code definitions are normally just the hex bits to send. The definition may start with #bitcount# to override the
    default bit count for the device. This may be used in the device table or in supplied parameters. For example,
    %#20#12345 will send 20 bits from the hex string 12345	
	If device is macro then parameter is the name of the file in SPIFFS containing the macro
  
JSON version is an array of commands using the same arguments allowing a sequence to be used using the POST to irjson
	Example
[
	{
		"device":"yamahaAV",
		"parameter":"hdmi4",
		"wait":"5000",
		"bits":"0",
		"repeat":"1"
	},
	{
		"device":"yamahaAV",
		"parameter":"hdmi1",
		"wait":"100",
		"bits":"0",
		"repeat":"1"
	}
]

Macros are held in SPIFFS files and have exactly the same content as a JSON POST. They are executed by using the device name 'macro'
and including the name of the macro file in the parameter field.

New macros can be generated by POSTING the macro content to /macro with the auth argument and an argument called macro containing name to be used.
E.g. 192.168.0.200/macro?auth=1234&macro=test1
Existing macros can be removed by using the same procedure but with no POST content.

Config
  Edit IRBlasterWeb.ino
    AP_SSID Local network ssid
	AP_PASSWORD 
	AP_PORT
	AP_IP If static IP to be used
	AP_AUTHID Pincode or password to authorise web commands
	update_username user for updating firmware
	update_password
	
Remote controls
  These are defined in BitDevices.h in the BitMessages library
  Currently 3 devices are fully defined (Yamaha AV Box, LGTV, YouView(BT) )
  To add a new device
    Increase NUMBER_DEVICES
	Create an array of buttons and Hex codes for that button
	Append 9 lines of new config data to devices e.g.
      	"youview", //name of device
	    "H9000,L4500", //header pulses
	    NULL, //trailer pulses
	    "H550,L550", // pulses for a data bit 0
	    "H550,L1600", // pulses for a data bit 1
		38000, //IR modulation frequency
		0, //special handling 0=Normal, 1 = rc6 bit 3 handling
	    100, //repeat gap mSec
	    33, //bit count
	    1, // minimum repeat
	    youviewMsgs  // pointer to button array
		
Libraries
  BitMessages Routines to look up and create pulse sequences for a commands
  BitTx Bit bang routines to execute a pulse sequence
    Interrupt driven and supports accurate modulation
	
Install procedure
	Normal arduino esp8266 compile and upload
	As SPIFFS is used then the memory should be prepared by installing and using the ESP8266 Sketch Data upload tool
	This will upload the data folder as initial SPIFFS content
	
Tool for gathering codes from a remote
  This is a simple python program (rxir.py) expected to run on a Raspberry Pi and using a demodulated IR receiver connected to a GPIO.
  Create a text file with a list of button names (broken into subsets for convenience). These files are named device-subset. When
  run it will prompt for device,subset and coding type (nec,rc5,rc6). The user is then asked to press the buttons. 
  The codes are then appended to a file called device.ircodes.
